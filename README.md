### About

This is a copy of v2 of the [Homepage SPA](https://github.com/d-mv/home-v2).

### Why

This project is done to practice the [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) language with something well-known, so to focus on the language and FP rather than on the looks and functionally of the app.

### Scripts

- `build` - builds the project
- `dev` - runs Elm's **reactor**
- `start` - runs project in _watch_ mode (rebuilds on every change)
- `start:production` - builds and run project (no _watch_ mode)
- `watch` - watches the changes in .elm files and rebuilds the project upon change
